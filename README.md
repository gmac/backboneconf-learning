# Learning

 - Hello
 - Vox Media / GA / Epoxy
 - Thank you Boucoup, Peter, Travis
 
# Backbone @ Vox

 - Explainer Cards: about 25% of Vox.com traffic.
 - Case study in how simple behavior can enhance storytelling.
 
# LEARNING

 - A series of simple truths the we already know.

## Learning is Hard
 
 - Antaginist is the CoC.
 - Sine wave of peaks and valleys representing our successes and struggles.
 - What is YOUR peak?
 - What valleys do you avoid?

## Growth Mindset

 - Learning starts with our attitude toward it.
 - See TED Talk by Eduardo Briceno.

## Mindsets

 - **Fixed Mindset**: engrained level of ability.
 	- "If winning makes us winners, then losing must make us losers."
  
 - **Growth Mindset**: intelligence is malleable. We grow our own potential.
   - "I don't know, YET."

## Yes, Let's!

 - We've made a game of this in our classroom.
 - Simple strategy for embracing challenge, and setting ongoing short-term goals.

## Mentorship

 - From interview panels and hiring officers:  
 *"What will this individual cost us?"*
 - Flip:  
   *"What are we lacking without them?""*
 
Powerful feedback loop...

  - **Seniors** distill their own knowledge. They teach themselves.
  - **Juniors** are fearless in conquering new material. They shift the foundation.

# Learning JavaScript

## Why is it so hard?
 - For such a small language, there's a disproportionate level of anger and misery associated.
 - Thank you, Angus Croll for explanation.
 - JavaScript is TWO languages:
 	- The simple familiar (tip).
 	- The abyssal powerhouse (depths).
 
## Understanding

 - My best answer to the challenge of JavaScript:
 - When we can't rely on the "familiar" parts, we feel unprepared for the advanced material.

## Core JavaScript

 - The solution: embrace the language in its entirety as "core" knowledge.
 - Demystifies many library-level programming patterns.
 
Aspirational:

 - **First-Class Functions**: functions as objects.  
 - **Closure & Scope**: who knows what, where.
 - **Contextual Invocation**: the meaning of "this".
 - **Prototypal Inheritance**: method sharing.

## Require(*);

 - NodeJS has made JavaScript an institution.
 - The only truly full-stack language.
 - However, this is still a microcosm within software development.
 
## Foreign Language:

 - Distilled research from the ACTFL...
 - Does this seem relevant to software engineers?
 - BONUS: also forestalls degenerative diseases of the brain!
 
 So:
 
 - Who feels they are a better programmer for knowing multiple languages?
 - Valuable lesson to the new generation who can choose to use only JavaScript.
   
# Learning Backbone

## So, Uh... What do I do with it?

 - Common question, even from skilled technicians.
 - Docs are functional, not conceptual.

## The Simple Lessons of Backbone

 - Deconstructed down into basic concepts.

## Backend / Frontend

 - Something of a religious debate.
 - BE is fundamentally simpler than FE.
 - BE is more streamlined, with more common solutions to finite problems.
 - In 2015, FE does not exist on its own.
   
## Model / View Separation

 - The Backbone visual-quickstart guide.
 - MV*? ... here it is.
 - THE simple lesson of Backbone.

## M/V is Freeform

 - Views share models!
 - Makes complex view updates quite easy.

## Collection / Model

 - How do these work together?
 - Their behaviors map directly to REST services.

## API / Modeling

 - API data doesn't always match model directly.
 - Use "parse" to reconcile differences.
 - We want to avoid convoluted models.

## Routers
 - There are no simple lessons.
 - Thanks James!

# Learning the Future

## A Retrospective
 
 - NOT about obesity, but about maps.
 - This is my story, and I'm sure most of you have something similar (or will soon)...
   - HTML image maps.
   - Macromedia Director.
   - Flash.
   - D3 / TopoJSON.
 - While tools and data formats have changed, we're still doing the EXACT SAME THING.

## Design Patterns

 - There's a book about this...
 - 15 years post-"Software Design Patterns".
 - The book's original influences can still be seen today.
 
SO:
 
 - **As technology evolves, we remember software not for it's code, but for its design.**
 - How will we remember Backbone?
 
## Backbone in 2025

 - What do we remember, and/or what still applies?

## Start Over
 
 - Conway's Game of Life.
 - Cited among the most valuable days of class.
   - Letting go.
   - Breaking the cycle.
   - Starting over.

SO:

- That's not to say that we should start over without cause...
- **But when the time comes for the change:**
 
## Yes, Let's.
