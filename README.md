1) TITLE
 - Hello
 - Thank you, Boucoup

2) Backbone @ Vox shoutout
 - BB Cardstacks are servicing 26% of Vox.com traffic.

3) Learning Objectives
 - Here to talk about learning

4) LEARNING.

5) Learning is Hard
 - Challenge is cyclicle
 - Difficult when getting starting
 - Also, easy to get comfortable and stuck

6) Growth Mindset
 - Moving forward is a mindset.
 - Excellent TED talk on this by Eduardo Briceno, we'll watch 1 minute.
 - Eduardo starts by talking about Josh Waitzkin, a multi-talented Chess/martial arts champion.
 - Josh doesn't see himself as a prodigee, but 

7) VIDEO
 - That is an excellent talk, I encourage you to watch the whole video.

8) I Don't Know... Yet.
 - This is Eduardo's final thesis regarding confronting new challenges.

9) Yes, Let's!
 - Or, as we've made this something of a game in the GA classroom...
 - Becomes a running montra, and pushes infividuals to face new challenges.

10) Mentorship
 - I've talked to many professionals who feel that juniors are a burden.
 - Mentorship is a powerful tool for creating a loop for new and old ideas.
 - This is mutually beneficial to both the junior and the senior developer.

11) LEARNING FOUNDATION.

12) JavaScript is Small.
 - I don't know about you, but these language parts are almost all I ever use.
 - Try putting the "bare minimum" of Ruby into a single presentation slide!
 - I'm consistently surprised by how often I hear JavaScript cited as a major weakness.

13) So why is it Hard?
 - JavaScript is a deceptively complex with a lot of nuance.
 - The common problem I see is developers not getting past the "easy" parts to embrace the real power of the language.

14) Ironically, embracing only the "easy" parts of JavaScript makes many operations seem illogical, and thus makes the language more confusing as a whole.
 - So: "Take the gloves off and stop tickling it."
 - Also demystifies a lot of library-level programming patterns.

15) JS, The Real Parts
 - We CAN train better JavaScript programmers,
 - We just need to push them harder.

16) Backend / Frontend
 - Something of a religious debate.
 - I'd vote BACKEND FIRST:
 - 1) BE is generally more streamlined.
 - 2) BE has more common solutions to common problems.
 - 3) In 2015, FE needs a BE to talk to.

17) Benefits of Multiple Languages
 - American Council for the Teaching of Foreign Languages
 - This research applies to learning Foreign Languages
 - Does is seem relevant to programming?
 - Who feels they are a better programmer for knowing multiple languages?
 - BONUS: You also forestall degenerative diseases of the brain!

18) Learning Backbone

19) So, Uh... What do I do with it?
 - I hear this question frequently, even from skilled technicians.
 - Docs detail methods for a workflow that is not readily obvious.

20) The Simple Lessons of Backbone

21) Model / View Separation
 - This is THE simple lesson of Backbone.
 - Understanding M/V separation is the fundamental lesson.

22) M/V is One-To-Many
 - Commonly overlooked: Views can share a model.
 - Makes complex view updates remarkably easy.

23) Collection / Model
 - Common source of confusion: why two components?
 - Boiling them down, they map 1:1 with RESTful routes

24) API / Modeling
 - API data doesn't always match model structures 1:1.
 - Use parse to reconcile differences rather than convoluted modeling.

25) Routers
 - Are hard.
 - Are nothing like Backend Routes.
 - Require the single biggest conceptual leap in Backbone.

26) LEARNING THE FUTURE

27) A Retrospective
 - First map: mid-90's using image maps.
 - Next: during college using Macromedia Director.
 - 2000's: Flash. Ahead of its time.
 - Now: SVG has caught up, TopoJSON is in, D3 is killing it.
 - Future: D3 will inevitable become an antiquity.

28) Design Patterns
 - Gang of Four cite NeXTStep OO-frameworks as an influence for "Design Patterns".
 - Their book, and the themes it embodies, transcends generations of technology.

29) Backbone
 - Backbone embodies many time-tested patterns of software design.
 - While it will inevitably be surpassed, its lessons will live on.

30) Start Over
 - A closing anecdote:
 - Conway's Game of Life is a day-long classroom exercise.
 - 45 minute blocks, rotate pairs, delete all code at the end.
 - Students consistently cite it as the most valuable day of class.
 - They day they learned "letting go", and advancing ideas down the emotional cycle of change.
